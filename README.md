- A public repository of GoPro's Flat gamma 1D Luts for converting it to linear gamma and back.  
- These operations are done implementing the math provided by GoPro Labs.  
- In the LUT names the Flat gamma is refred as "log113" (as in log base 113) and linear gamma as "lin".  
- You can download both 1D luts to convert from Flat to Linear (log113_to_lin.cube) and Linear to Flat (lin_to_log113)
